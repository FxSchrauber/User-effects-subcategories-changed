This is the master controller for the entire remote control user effects subsystem.  
It generates the remote control channels 1 to 5 at the one output (to which, of course, several effects can be connected).  
By itself it does very little, but when used with the appropriate effects it is a very powerful tool.  
The desired channel to be used is selected in the custom remote-controllable effect.  

All channels can be controlled simultaneously by means of a "Master" slider.  
As with all adjustable controls, here keyframing can be used.  
In turn, that Master can itself be remote controlled.  
The "Multiply", parameter allows the master signal to amplify, attenuate or invert the individual control channels.  
Each channel can be set directly, and the remote control signal may also be limited.
